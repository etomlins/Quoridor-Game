# The Aim of The Game
Quoridor is a two-player game. The object of the game is to get to the other side of the board. On each turn, a player can either move or place a wall that obscures the other player's path or makes a path for themselves all while enjoying lo-fi hip hop beats. 

# Specifications
1. The screen displays a 9x9 grid—9 squares for pieces with 8 spaces for fences in-between (technically 17x17).
2. The screen also displays the move number and the number of fences remaining for each player.
3. On each turn, a player can either place a fence in the grid or click themselves to move.  
4. If the player has no fences remaining, he will not be allowed to place a fence. 
5. When a player clicks on their piece, the UI displays the available moves to that player based on the walls and the player’s position.
6. As a user hovers their cursor around the board, the UI displays valid spaces for fences.
7. If a player’s piece is adjacent to the other player’s piece, they can jump over that player.
8. If a player’s piece is adjacent to the other player’s piece but there is a wall behind them, the player can jump to the space adjacent to the other player, provided there is no wall blocking that direction also.
9. If a player reaches any space on the last row of the other side of the board, that player is declared the winner and the game ends.
10. While playing the game, a track of relaxing, lo-fi hip-hop beats plays in the background for user enjoyment.
